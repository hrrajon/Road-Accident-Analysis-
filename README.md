# ðŸš¦ Road Accident Dashboard - Excel Project ðŸ“Š

## **Overview**
This repository contains a **Road Safety Dashboard** that analyzes and visualizes road accident data for the years **2021 and 2022**. The dashboard provides valuable insights into accident trends, casualty statistics, and contributing factors, helping to enhance road safety awareness and data-driven decision-making.

## **Problem Statement**
The objective of this project is to develop an **interactive Road Safety Dashboard** to analyze accident data from **2021 and 2022**, focusing on the following key insights:

### **ðŸ“Œ Primary KPIs**
- **Total Casualties** â€“ The total number of casualties resulting from road accidents.
- **Casualty Distribution by Severity** â€“ Percentage of casualties categorized by accident severity (Fatal, Serious, Slight).
- **Vehicle Involvement** â€“ Identifying vehicle types that contribute to the highest number of casualties.

### **ðŸ“Œ Secondary KPIs & Insights**
- **Casualties by Vehicle Type** â€“ Understanding accident impact across different vehicle categories.
- **Monthly Casualty Trends** â€“ Year-over-year comparison of casualty trends.
- **High-Risk Road Types** â€“ Identifying road types with the highest number of casualties.
- **Casualty Distribution by Road Surface** â€“ Assessing the impact of road conditions on accidents.
- **Time & Location Analysis** â€“ Examining casualties based on area classification (urban/rural) and time of occurrence (day/night).

## **ðŸ“‚ Dataset**
The dataset consists of **UK road accident data**, containing **3.07 million rows** and **21 attributes** for the years **2021 and 2022**. The data is structured as a single table and includes key fields such as:
- **Accident Date & Time**
- **Location (Urban/Rural)**
- **Road Type & Surface Condition**
- **Vehicle Type**
- **Casualty Count & Severity (Fatal, Serious, Slight)**
- **Lighting Conditions (Day/Night)**
